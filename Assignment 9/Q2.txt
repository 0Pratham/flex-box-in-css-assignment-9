Q -> . Explain the role of following key properties in flexbox layout model .
   1 -> justify content :  

	
   2 -> align-items :  The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox container or in given window.

   3 -> gap :  The gap property defines the size ofthe gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox layout.
		 It is a shorthand for the properties row-gap and column-gap

   4 -> flex-direction :  The flex-directionproperty specifies the direction of the flexible items.
			  Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-directionproperty has no effect.
			  and for doing this we need to introduce 'display' property and set value 'flex' .

   5 -> flex-wrap :  The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
